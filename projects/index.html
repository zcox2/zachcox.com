				Student Aircraft Builders
			</h2>
			<p>
				In the fall semester of my sophomore year (2012), I started noticing my roommate and close friend, Erik Lopez, carrying around a black binder suspiciously labeled "Super Secret Project". Erik had made a collection of discoveries that, alone, would have been worthy of little interest, but together revealed a thrilling opportunity. We discovered that regular guys in garages <i>regularly</i> built their own airplanes for private use. A previous group on campus had attempted to begin construction of one of these planes, leaving an empennage kit (~$1,800) unused and owned by the aerospace engineering department. And, icing on the cake, due to the downsizing at the Institute of Aviation, a hangar space previously used for training aircraft mechanics was completely vacant. So when Erik opened that binder to reveal the manufacturing instructions for the tail kit and explained his other discoveries, I was thrilled at the possibilities.</p>

				People around my age are known to be a bit impulsive at times. For major financial decisions, that can be crippling. But when it's tempered with a bit of good sense, it becomes a fantastic tool for starting a movement. So, being young, we ran away with some half-baked plan to start building an airplane using engineering students with absolutely no experience. That was impulsive, but it was all the more awesome when that plan gained traction and created one of the most creative and uninhibited environments I've ever worked in.</p>

				The University of Illinois is a pretty huge school, and it attracts some really talented students too. The combination of those has created unparalleled opportunity for exploring crazy ideas like these. With SAB, we've seen the impact a few inspired students can make with one well defined goal, and now we find ourselves surrounded by them - inspired students and lofty goals both. Our biggest challenge at the moment is just making sure that we make full use of them.</p>
