				<h2>Student Aircraft Builders</h2>
				<p>
					In the fall semester of my sophomore year (2012), I started noticing my roommate and close friend, Erik Lopez, carrying around a black binder suspiciously labeled "Super Secret Project". Erik had made a collection of discoveries that, alone, would have been worthy of little interest, but together revealed a thrilling opportunity. We discovered that regular guys in garages <i>regularly</i> built their own airplanes for private use. A previous group on campus had attempted to begin construction of one of these planes, leaving an empennage kit (~$1,800) unused and owned by the aerospace engineering department. And, icing on the cake, due to the downsizing at the Institute of Aviation, a hangar space previously used for training aircraft mechanics was completely vacant. So when Erik opened that binder to reveal the manufacturing instructions for the tail kit and explained his other discoveries, I was thrilled at the possibilities.</p>

					People around my age are known to be a bit impulsive at times. For major financial decisions, that can be crippling. But when it's tempered with a bit of good sense, it becomes a fantastic tool for starting a movement. So, being young, we ran away with some half-baked plan to start building an airplane using engineering students with absolutely no experience. That was impulsive, but it was all the more awesome when that plan gained traction and created one of the most creative and uninhibited environments I've ever worked in.</p>
				<p>
					The University of Illinois is a pretty huge school, and it attracts some really talented students too. The combination of those has created unparalleled opportunity for exploring crazy ideas like these. With SAB, we've seen the impact a few inspired students can make with one well defined goal, and now we find ourselves surrounded by them - inspired students and lofty goals both. Our biggest challenge at the moment is just making sure that we make full use of them. The website isn't updated as often as I'd like it to be, but a fair amount of content is hosted at <a href="http://sab.ae.illinois.edu">sab.ae.illinois.edu</a>.</p>

				<h2>Mechanical Engineering Design Classes</h2>
				<p>
					The mechanical engineering program at the University of Illinois has a number of courses that are designed to build skills while simultaneously developing team collaboration, design engineering, and task management experience. The focuses of each class are unique. So while designing for manufactureability was one of the key goals in ME 350, it is not emphasized in our mechanisms courses, ME 370 and 371 - despite ample opportunity. I've chosen to submit these exactly as they were submitted, rather than doctor the content. So you'll probably be able to see some changes in style over the course of my time here. </p>

						<h3>ME 170</h3>
						<img src="Images/ME170_truck.jpg" width="200"/>

						<p>
							ME 170 is our introduction to Computer Aided Design class. In addition to teaching the students their first CAD program, ME 170 also strove to provide good design engineering principles and introduce cost estimation tools. The class (at the time) taught ProEngineer 5.0 through a series of labs designed to guide us directly through the basics. About halfway through the semester, we broke off into partners to model a mechanism of our own design, complete with geometric dimensioning and tolerancing of each part. Our design was a floating axle for a longboard truck, designed to minimize friction between (ultimately) the road and the rider. The submitted final report is <a href="ME170_writeup.pdf">here</a>.</p>

						<h3>ME 350</h3>
						<img src="Images/ME350_keysaber.png" width="275"/>
						<p>
							ME 350 is Design for Manufacture. It's our first major exposure to actual manufacturing, and also the first major design project. Teams of 3 - 5 tackle a complete product design, including market analysis, cost analysis, and design for manufacture. The final design was then taken to prototype and demonstrated in the final presentation, which doubled as a "Shark Tank" style sales pitch (*wince*). Our design tackeled the common inconvenience of carrying keys, offering a replacement to the standard keyring. This product, the "KeySaber", would fold your keys while not in use - preventing damage to your other pocket-riders. The keys could then be easily unfolded when needed. While the protoype was pretty rough, our experiences producing it were invaluable. It was made readily apparent to us how easy it is to over-engineer designs. This project taught us the value of an early protoype - figure out your design is broken when it's still early enough to fix it. The final typed report can be found <a href="ME350_writeup.pdf">here</a>.</p>

						<h3>ME 370</h3>
						<img src="Images/ME370_BLAM.png" width="300"/>
						<p>
							ME 370 is our first mechanisms course. The emphasis of the class is the dynamic and static stress analysis of mechanisms. These topics are introduced by their application to a guided design project. The goal of the project was to create a ball launching mechanism (BLAM). The design was constrained to a 2'x2'x1' -  and I'm sure you can guess which way it was oriented (not the easy way). The challenge of the constraints offered us a real opportunity to practice our design engineering, and the result is something that we're happy with. I know it gave me a chance to utilize my NX experience - we were moving quick under the deadline. It's currently only about 3 weeks into the design though (as of March 30th 2014), so don't be surprised if it's changed fairly soon. You can see the report we submitted <a href="ME370_midyear_writeup.pdf">here</a>.</p>
