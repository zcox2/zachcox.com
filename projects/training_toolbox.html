				This training toolbox (sold by Van's Aircraft) was used to teach interested SAB members the basic fabrication skills that they would use most heavily in the construction of the aircraft. </p>

			I'm a mechanical engineering student attending the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I've been called "Aero Curious" by the aerospace engineers I find myself surrounded by, an accusation I'm no longer able to refute. I cofounded the organization <a href="http://sab.ae.illinois.edu">Student Aircraft Builders</a> alongside some really amazing students in Fall 2012. The organization has grown to around 70 weekly active members, and is well on its way to constructing an airplane - and that's only our excuse for doing a ton of even cooler stuff. I'm currently still working on learning CSS for this page, but if you're interested in contacting me, my email address is <a href="zcox2@illinois.edu">zcox2@illinois.edu</a>.
