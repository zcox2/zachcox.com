				This section is relatively personal, and I'm sure that the majority of the people visiting this site won't have any interest in reading it. So this is really for the smaller proportion who might be trying find out more than my skills and experiences. For those, "How's it going?"</p>
			<p>
				I grew up in a small town (5,000 residents) in Illinois called Wilmington. I've been playing various sports since I was a kid, but stuck with soccer during high school. Winter, the only season that soccer wasn't a possibility, was filled with competing in Argonne National Labs' Rube Goldberg Machine Competition - a pastime I credit with my choice of engineering. It was a great way to combine a lot of the handyman skills I learned from my family with my propensity for building cool things. </p>

				My extended family is extremely close, both socially <i>and</i> geographically. Our yearly vacation to the Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri is without exception my favorite week of the year, and also the reason that I adore boating and skiiing as much as I do.</p>
